# Memory Game Project

This is an interactive browser-based card matching memory game (also known as Concentration).

## Run

Run the game by opening 'index.html' in a Web browser.

## How the game works

The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match! 

In each turn:
  * The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol. (Clicking on a card reveals the hidden side of it.)
  * The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
  * If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
  * If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
