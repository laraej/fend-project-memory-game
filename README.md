## How the game works

The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match! 

In each turn:
  * The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol. (Clicking on a card reveals the hidden side of it.)
  * The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
  * If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
  * If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.

While playing you can see the time since the beginning of the game and the number of moves.

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched. At the end of the game you can see how many seconds it has taken you to win the game. Also you can see in how many moves you have won and how many stars you have gained. (3 stars: 32 moves or less, 2 stars: 48 moves or less, 1 star: 49 moves or more.)

After reaching the end of the game, you can continue playing a new round by clicking on the refresh arrow.
